HOW TO USE OUR PLAYER:

Go to the Main.java and run in Eclispe. A prompt will appear on the console asking for what file to play.
Type in the name of the file without the .abc suffix.

Eg.
If you want to play abc_song.abc, type into the console "abc_song".

There should be no whitespaces in the input. It should just be what comes before ".abc"
in the name of the abc file. Make sure that the abc file is located in the sample_abc folder.

If you want to quit the loop, type "q" into the console after the prompt.
Some songs may take a while to parse, so please be patient.
